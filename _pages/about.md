Starting from October 2019, I am a PhD candidate in the project-team [COSMIQ](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/inde-en.html) at [Inria Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en) (France), working under the supervision of [Jean-Pierre Tillich](https://www.paris.inria.fr/secret/Jean-Pierre.Tillich/). Before that, I obtained a Master's degree in Mathematics (Curriculum Coding Theory and Cryptography) from the University of Trento (Italy) in 2019 and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Parma (Italy) in 2017.

My current research interests lie primarily in the area of **code-based cryptography**. In particular, my PhD project focuses on the security of cryptographic schemes that rely on codes with an underlying algebraic structure. Their **cryptanalysis** involves the use of techniques borrowed from **algebraic coding theory** as well as from **computational algebra**, such as Gr&#246;bner bases.
