I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [CISPA - Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en) in the [Algorithmic Cryptology](https://cispa.de/en/research/groups/joux) group led by [Antoine Joux](https://cispa.de/en/people/c01anjo). Before, I have been a PhD student in the project-team [COSMIQ](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/inde-en.html) at [Inria Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en) (France), working under the supervision of [Jean-Pierre Tillich](https://www.paris.inria.fr/secret/Jean-Pierre.Tillich/). 

My current research interests lie primarily in the area of **post-quantum cryptography**, whose aim is to study cryptographic systems that are considered secure even against quantum algorithms. In particular, my research focuses on the cryptanalysis of schemes coming from **code-based cryptography** and **multivariate cryptography** through techniques borrowed from **computational algebra**, such as **Gr&#246;bner bases**. 
I am also interested in several aspects of **algebraic coding theory**.

My short CV can be found [here](assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
