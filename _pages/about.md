I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [CISPA - Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en) in the [Algorithmic Cryptology](https://cispa.de/en/research/groups/joux) group led by [Antoine Joux](https://cispa.de/en/people/c01anjo). Between April and October 2023, I was research engineer within the project-team [COSMIQ](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/inde-en.html) at [Inria Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en) (France). From October 2019 to March 2023, I have been a PhD student in the same team, working under the supervision of [Jean-Pierre Tillich](https://www.paris.inria.fr/secret/Jean-Pierre.Tillich/). Before that, I obtained a Master's degree in Mathematics (Curriculum Coding Theory and Cryptography) from the University of Trento (Italy) in 2019 and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Parma (Italy) in 2017.

My current research interests lie primarily in the area of **code-based cryptography**. This includes cryptosystems whose security relies on the hardness of decoding a linear error correcting code and represents one of the most promising alternatives in **post-quantum cryptography**. In particular, I focused on the security of cryptographic schemes built from codes with an underlying algebraic structure, such as **GRS codes** and their subfield subcodes: **alternant** and **Goppa codes**. Their **cryptanalysis** involves the use of techniques borrowed from **algebraic coding theory** as well as from **computational algebra**, for instance **Gr&#246;bner bases**.
